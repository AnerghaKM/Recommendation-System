# Recommendation-System
A simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences, using techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

# Collaborative Filtering

It uses user behavior to find similarities between items or users, and suggests items based on these similarities.

- **User-Based:** Recommends items by finding similar users and suggesting items those users liked.

- **Item-Based:** Recommends items by finding similar items to what the user liked.

- **Matrix Factorization:** A more advanced technique that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors.

# Content-Based Filtering

It uses item features to recommend similar items to what the user has liked before.

- Recommends items by comparing the content (features) of items with the user's past preferences.
